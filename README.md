## Technologies / Concepts Used
* Java
* Polymorphism
* Inheritance
* Switches
* Encapsulation
* Getters / Setters
* Interfaces / Implementation
* Try / Catch blocks
* Abstract methods
* Array lists
* FileReader / Buffered Reader

## Lessons Learned

*Clearing the queue for a scanner after nextInt*  
*Only using the scanner in 1 class to prevent leak issue or closing the scanner too early*
*Preventing exceptions using if statements*    
*Using instanceof to call methods on specific subclasses*
